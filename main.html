    <td id="para"><h2>Object</h2>Blueprints are technical architectural drawings traditionally printed on blue paper with white lines — hence the name. Today, the term refers more broadly to any detailed construction drawings used on-site to guide the building process. 
These plans include everything from floor plans and elevation drawings to electrical layouts and structural specs, making them essential for translating architectural designs into physical structures.
What sets blueprints apart from architectural sketches or conceptual 3D renderings is their level of detail and accuracy. While sketches help convey design ideas early on, and 3D renderings provide 
		visual appeal for clients, blueprints are the architectural design documents used by construction teams to execute the build.
